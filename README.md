# Full-Stack-Shopper
Full Stack E-Commerce site using Commerce.js

This project was created to showcase dynamic product generation based on Commerce.js. 

Pages fetch data from Commerce.js for Category and Product information. 
That data is then manipulated to create a sort-and-search-able Home page, dynamic Product pages, and a real-world checkout experience.

TEST CREDENTIALS
Customers are not created on Commerce.js like categories and products are. 

This project is mainly about the ecommerce aspect so as such the customer login/signup functionality is barebones, and existing accounts are hardcoded.

If you wish to sign in rather than create account 
(the latter of which has no requirements - the signup form can be filled with any appropriate information but it won't be saved on refresh), 
then you may use the TEST ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS - username: test@user.com password: asdf123!
